## Homework1

### Description
In this homework you will practice to write a Neural Network classifier in Python using the Pytorch framework. You need to understand how a Neural Network classifier works, including back propagation and gradient descent in order to implement this homework successfully. The goal of this homework is: 

- To implement and understand a Neural Network classifier. 
- Get familiar with using pytorch  

### Homework1 Usage

run "python classify.py train" to train a model

run "python classify.py test xxx.png" to test any picture sized (32,32,3)

## Homework2

### Description

### In this homework you will practice how to write a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier
in Python with the Pytorch framework. You need to understand how a CNN works, including
backpropagation and gradient descent in order to implement this homework successfully. The goal
of this homework is:

- To implement and understand the CNN architecture.
